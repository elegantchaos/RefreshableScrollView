# RefreshableScrollView

 This is a modified version of the view presented here:
 https://swiftui-lab.com/scrollview-pull-to-refresh/

 Many thanks to SwiftUI Lab for the inspiration.

 The need to pass in a binding has been removed, and it works with
 the standard `refreshable` modifier introduced in SwiftUI 3.

 It is intended for situations where you want pull-to-refresh, but
 don't want to use `List`.
